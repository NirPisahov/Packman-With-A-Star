Hi! this is the beta version of Packman, using a-star algorithm for path-finding.
The algorithm is adjusted to my map stacture and was writen especially for this.
In the future I'll add:
1) Map builder for random and smart packman map builder.
2) Make the game much more interactive by changing the game loop and writing a much better code.
3) Fixing some bugs that I found in movements.
4) Build the game itself using the existing base(Have to add: add packmen, end-game panel, welcome panel)

System Requests:
Java JDK-13.
Make sure the compilation level is 13 (via Eclipse project properties).
Enable preview features (--enable-preview) also via Eclipse project properties. In 'Java Compiler' tab.

And you're ready to go!

If you have any problem in setting up the project. or you have any compilation/runtime errors. leave me a message, 
and I'll upload a vesrion of this in lower-level compilation that should work for anybody.
